# DungEon
rot.js roguelike based on RogueBasin Rot.js tutorial.
# CHANGELOG
09.05.2017:
 - Development of this roguelike has started
 - The code is almost equal to the code in the tutorial
 - Added "glyphs" (colored characters with position). Are they needed?
 - Useful feature: boxes are disappearing after being opened (if they were empty)
